# **ABSTRACT**
 With the era of smart technologies, everything is getting smarter and smart transport system is one of the fields which is going to put a huge impact on our lives. Traffic Signal Using Atmega328 and Ultrasonic Sensor is one of the example. 
Atmega328 being one of the easiest microcontrollers to use, easy to program, easily available in local markets is popular among the students and hobbyists.

Knowing all that, I put my knowledge to make this Density-based traffic signal using Atmega328 microcontroller with all the components that are easily available.

This project is a prototype of density based controlling of traffic lights which will check the densities on both ways and will decide which light should be on.
