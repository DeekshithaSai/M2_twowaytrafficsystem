# **TWO WAY TRAFFIC SYSTEM**

# **ABSTRACT**
With the era of smart technologies, everything is getting smarter and smart transport system is one of the fields which is going to put a huge impact on our lives. Traffic Signal Using Atmega328 and Ultrasonic Sensor is one of the example
 Atmega328 being one of the easiest microcontrollers to use, easy to program, easily available in local markets is popular among the students and hobbyists.
Knowing all that, I put my knowledge to make this Density-based traffic signal using Atmega328 microcontroller with all the components that are easily available.
This project is a prototype of density based controlling of traffic lights which will check the densities on both ways and will decide which light should be on.

# **Hardware Requirements:**
* Atmega328 microcontroller

# **WORKING**
A digital traffic control system can be made using ultrasnic sensors
along with micro controller and LED’s which can prove a
worth for the real time application controlling traffic signals
based on the congestion of traffic. Ultrasnic sensor placed in the
at the road and distance is set from the signal placed
in the junction the time delay in the traffic signal is set based
on the congestion of vehicles on the road.
The ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the distance of vehicles in the
road according to the number of vehicles, microcontroller takes
appropriate decisions as to which road is to be given the
highest priority and the longest time delay for the
corresponding traffic light. We will be implement ultrasonic sensor
in the range of 50m’s to 100m’s range in real time
implementation.
The system consist of the following three hardware
components: Display, Detector & Controller. We used three
type of LED’s Red, Yellow & Green each side of junction.
Detector sense the presence of vehicles in front of sensor and
send the signal to the microcontroller.

# **ADVANTAGES AND APPLICATION**
Digital traffic control reduce traffic congestion and time
spend on the road to Improve efficiency. Make the road safer
and reducing the chance of accidence. It provide data to
further improve transportation. It reduce the possibilities of
traffic jams caused by traffic lights an extend and decreases
pollution by reducing congestion.
This Traffic Control system is very efficiently used in metro
cities. It will help us to reduce traffic problems in urban areas.
It is used to reduce the rout of traffic.

# **CONCLUSION**
In this prject we have implemented the optimization of traffic
controller in cities using ultrasonic sensors and microcontroller. Since
the ultrasonic sensor costs less the project costs less. Presently in the
general system usage the important vehicles like ambulance,
fire engines, government vehicles, etc. those can’t be stop for
longer duration. Whenever there is high density traffic on one
side then controller given the green colour on
that side. Once the traffic density is cleared on all side the
general timing is followed.
